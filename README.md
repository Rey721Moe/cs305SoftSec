•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

o	The client Artemis Financial a financial dedicated firm, that provides financial services to their client base, based on the need of their clients. Their goal was implement a high level security to protect their clients information as well any data that is being transferred that it is secured and encrypted to eliminate the access from unauthorize personnel.

•	What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

o	I think one thing I did well was running Maven to scan the code for potential vulnerabilities, allowing me to identify potential issues. Another way that worked for me was doing a manual review of the code.

•	What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

o	I think identifying the false positive was challenging for me.

•	How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

o	By creating an SSL Certificate as well as ensuring the project has an HTTPO post, the layers of security increased as well. When considering the future, finding, and identifying, as well as figuring out all or any false positives, will be a good strategy to apply.

•	How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

o	For me to be able to ensure the code was secure and in working order, the project had to be run several times, including running it as a dependency check. As for refactoring the code, I was required to verify that I ran the program to verify for any new vulnerabilities.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

o	The use of Eclipse worked for me, and I will continue to do so due to its reliability.

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

o	I think the Vulnerability Assessment Report would be a good start, as well as my knowledge of how to find the information given and understand it.
